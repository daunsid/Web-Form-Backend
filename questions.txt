I worry that people I feel close to will leave me or abandon me
I donâ€™t feel that important relationships will last; I expect them to end
I become upset when someone leaves me alone,  even for a short period of time
I cannot count on people who support me to be there on a regular basis
I cannot be myself or express what I really feel, or people will leave me
